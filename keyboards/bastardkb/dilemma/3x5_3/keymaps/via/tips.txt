To compile and flash the firmware (takes a couple minutes):
	qmk flash -c -kb bastardkb/dilemma/3x5_3 -km <keymap>
		I edited the existing "via" keymap because I'm lazy, so substitute via for <keymap>

To convert images to display on the LCD:
	qmk painter-convert-graphics -f <color format> -i <image_file> -o <output_directory>
		I used pal16 color format because it worked and I had a simple image
		I resized the PNG images I used to 240x240 pixels to make it match the screen
		I also cropped them to circles because I used a circular LCD

Make sure to update the following files when using a new image:
	rules.mk (change SRC)
	keymap.c (change #include and qp_load_image_mem)
